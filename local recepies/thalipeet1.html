<h2>What is Thalipeeth</h2>



<p>Thalipeeth is a savory flatbread made using a combination of different flours. It is typically made using Bhajani Flour and can be almost made instantly if you have the flour ready. However, for many of us, this is not possible due to the non-availability of mills or any circumstances. So this Instant Thalipeeth version comes to the rescue.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br></p>



<p>Another thalipeeth I make is this <a href="https://cookwithrenu.com/sabudana-pancake-fritters-chila/">Sabudana Thalipeeth</a> or <a href="https://cookwithrenu.com/sabudana-pancake-fritters-chila/">Sabudana Fritters/Pancake/chila</a>. Another nutritious thalipeeth and is a good substitute for <a href="https://cookwithrenu.com/sabudana-vada/">sabudana vada</a> on your fasting days.</p>



<p><br></p>



<h2><strong>What is Bhajani?</strong></h2>



<p>Bhajani means flour made by the roasting of the different grains and then grinding. In the Marathi language, roasting means bhajane and hence the term Bhajani.</p>

<p><br></p>



<h2><strong>Bhajani Flour for Thalipeeth</strong></h2>



<p>Bhajani flour thalipeeth generally will have a combination of different grains. There are as many as 9 types or more grains that can be added. Grains are dry roasted and then floured in a mill. As this is dry roasted and floured, this bhajani flour stays good for a couple of months.</p>



<p><br></p>



<p>So when you want to make a thalipeeth, all you have to do is use this flour, add the required spices and make the thalipeeth. So it becomes kinda instant when you have the flour ready.</p>



<h2><strong>Instant Thalipeeth</strong></h2>



<p>This version is best for those who do not have access to the mill or cannot make their own from grains. I too do not have access to a mill and we love thalipeeth. So I make this instant version with whichever flours are available in my pantry.</p>



<p><br></p>



<h2><strong>Gluten Free Thalipeeth</strong></h2>



<p>The main flours are Jowar, Bajra, Rice, Besan, and Wheat. At times Wheat may or may not be used and if you want to make a Gluten Free Thalipeeth you would need to skip wheat and asafoetida if using. One can then add Ragi, Urad dal flour (in small portion), etc too. Basically, you can play with the flours you have.</p>



<h2><strong>Healthy Flatbread for Winters</strong></h2>



<p>Due to the combination of such healthy flours used, this recipe is one of the healthiest breakfast or meal recipes you can enjoy. It is especially good during winters. For kids, you can skip the chili and it is one of the best finger food you can give.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br></p>



<h2><strong>Travel Food / Lunch Box Idea</strong></h2>



<p>Thalipeeth stays good for 1-2 days too. You can enjoy it the next day too and it is best as a travel snack or meal. Kids would love to enjoy this in their lunchbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><br></p>



<h2><strong>Recipe process of Instant Thalipeeth</strong></h2>



<p>To the flours, you add sesame seeds, onion, chopped coriander, and coriander powder. In bhajani thalipeeth, at times coriander and cumin seeds are added to be floured. In the instant version, you can add the powder.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br></p>



<p>Then you make a dough using all the flour. You would be requiring little to no water as the onion releases its water. I like to add more onion and coriander in this as it adds to taste.</p>



<p>One can roll the thalipeeth directly on the <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZH2VDw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tava/pan</a> or roll it on a rolling board or a wet muslin cloth/ plastic sheet and then flip it over the pan. It has to be cooked on a slow to the medium stove to get evenly cooked.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br></p>



<p>I like to top it up with slit green chili seasoned with some salt. It adds to taste. I have learned this from a close friend. She made it for me and we really enjoyed it. After that, I always add the slit green chilies.</p>



<p><br></p>



<p>This is best enjoyed with some yogurt on the side or some green chilly kharda or thecha. Though it is famous as a typical Maharashtrian dish it can be even enjoyed as a meal or a snack.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br></p>



<h2><strong>Variations to Thalipeeth</strong></h2>



<p>If one wants to make a gluten free version of this thalipeeth skip the wheat flour and store-bought asafoetida powder. One can add maize flour (makki ka atta), tapioca flour, ragi flour, dal flour too in this.</p>



<p><br></p>



<p>Instead of onion, one can add different veggies in this thalipeeth. It would be multigrain as well as loaded with veggies. One healthy and delicious flatbread.</p>



<h2><br>Update</h2>



<p>I have shared this recipe earlier. Today I am updating the post with more information about flours used and replacements and with video on how to make the thalipeeth.</p>



<h2>So here goes the recipe of Instant Thalipeeth-</h2>
